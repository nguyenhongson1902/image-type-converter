# Image Type Converter
A tool for converting a file format to another (E.g: PNG -> JPG)

## Description
This example project is to convert the PNG format into the JPG format

- PNG is a lossless compression file format. It means every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored
- JPG is a lossy compression file format. It reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information.


## Installation 
`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

Main package: `pip install Pillow` (only for Python 3.x)
